What is extensibility?

A piece of code can do something different than before, based on the change in requirements,
but with minimum cost and effort to change.

A piece of code can't be extensible arbitrarily.

For a code to be extensible, first ask "extensibility for what?"

For a code to be extensible, we have to anticipate a particular type of change.

Who can anticipate really well?

There are 3 kinds of people on every team that makes software:
1. Those who know the domain really well but don't know software design as much
2. Those who know software design really well but don't know the domain as much
3. Those who know both really well
4. (We will politely ignore that 4th type for now)

To anticipate we need good knowledge of both the domain and the software design constraints.

Since most people belong to group 1 or group 2 we have to collaborate for effectively designing
for extensibility.
