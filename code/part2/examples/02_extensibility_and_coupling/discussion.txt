Tight coupling often makes design hard to extend and to test.

As much as possible favor loose coupling and also low coupling.

Fewer things to depend on lowers the frequency of change and lowers fragility of code
The more abstract a dependency is the more extensible the design is

But, please don't blindly use these principles or practices as they may lead to 
unnecessarily complex design.

We have to evaluate trade-offs and context really matters.
